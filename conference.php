We feel that it is important to focus on how an exhibition looks and feels, how the exhibitors and treated and how the guests feel at the event. We like to think that we are designing an event rather than an exhibition and we approach every exhibition this way.</p>

A great thing about these functions is that they are managed in an organized way and the school Management and staff members exercise full control to ensure an orderly execution of all programs lined up to take place at these events. Our experience in this field helps us in organizing these large functions without a single glitch throughout the entire duration of these school functions.

Starting from the setting up of shops in the waterproof canopy tents, to the management of stage, lighting effects, music system, photography and Videography, lighting in the entire area, arrangement of security at the entry point and exit points, ticket distribution counter for entry into the function, managing the fast foods supply at the venue, setting up hot and cold beverages outlets, distribution of program itinerary to the guests, arrangement of flower pots at the venue, there are several aspects of managing a school function that we have virtually memorized after handling a number of such events in the past.</p>
