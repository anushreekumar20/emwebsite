          <p class="py-5">The Mehendi ceremony is considered sacred in almost all wedding ceremonies in India. Here a couple of days before the wedding, the female friends and relatives of the bride get together and smear the bride with a paste of turmeric and sandalwood powder. This is followed by a ceremonial bath after which a person expert in designing Mehendi patterns or the Mehendiwali applies Mehendi on the hands and feet of the bride. We provide an all encompassing plan to conduct this ceremony keeping with the traditions and practices followed by our clients. From selecting and decorating the venue to going around the whole hog for shopping for clothes, jewellery, arranging professional folk artists for the song and dance accompanying such events, the food on offer etc are attended to in a detailed manner. Likewise, we provide expert assistance in planning out an outstanding Sangeet Ceremony with all the essential components thrown in at the right proportions.</p>

          <p class="py-5">We at Event Horizon are the firm believers that the only thing constant is ‘change’. No two people are the same, so how can two parties ever be the same? The theme has a lot to do with fusing in uniqueness and exclusivity to your party. Be it a wedding or a birthday party, a corporate event or a reunion- a theme of a party is to set the mood right.

Lately, themed parties have become quite a rage and the absence of theme makes a party just like yet-another-party where no distinctive passion are attached. We have themes for every function, mood and outlook and we’re sure to give you exactly what you’ve been looking for. From Rajwada Royal theme to add the princely touch to your wedding to the proud Peacock theme, the Sufi pink, the Classic English theme, Lotus theme, Retro theme, Wooden Rafter to Candle theme décor, Casino, Bollywood, Love and Bachelor theme- your options are galore to make a pick and get your event off to a great start.</p>
